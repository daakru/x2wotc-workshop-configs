;Note regarding Ability Ref names and spelling.

You may notice that some Mitzruti perks have poor spelling in their Ability Ref's. This is not a typo, at least not mine.
Please do not correct these mis-spellings when creating your classes, as the perk will fail to run.

I have corrected (and in many cases rewritten / renamed) every single Mitzruti perk localisation entry so in-game text is error free.
